<h6>Sprint-Boot vs Spring MVC?</h6>  
In previous world(Spring MVC), we use to do lot configuration in XML file and to set things up and running.     
Now Sprint-Boot is plug and play, everything is auto-configured to get you started.In case you want to add something you can
always add in application.properties file.      
It is future of spring and efficient for micro-services development.        
It follows convention(coding or actual work rather then spending time on creating configuration) over configuration.
Also features of embed Tomcat and Jetty(cool isn't it?).
        
                
This projects just created to teach how to get started in SpringBoot quick way.
